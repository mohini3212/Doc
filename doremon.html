<!--para intro-->
<p>Doraemon's physical appearance changed as the manga progressed. At first, he was predominantly kingfish color, with a blue tail, a white stomach, and flesh-colored hands and feet. He also stooped, and had a body much larger than his head. In later issues, he sported a smaller body, white hands and feet, and a red tail — the appearance most identified with him today. In the 1995 short film 2112: The Birth of Doraemon (as well as The Doraemons story arc set in the Robot School), it is revealed that Doraemon's original paint color was yellow, and had a more high-pitched voice than his current counterpart</p>

<p>Every story has its own secret gadget, and it is said the total number of gadgets is over 2,000. Here are some popular gadgets that appear throughout the series several times.

    Takecopter: ‘Take’ means ‘bamboo’ in Japanese and ‘copter’ comes from the word ‘helicopter’. If you put the takecopter on your head, you can fly.
    
    Dokodemo-door: It means ‘anyplace-door’. It is a portable door that takes you to any places in the world you wish to go.
    
    Time machine: It is in the drawer of Nobita’s desk. You can go either to the future or to the past.
    
    Copy Robot: If you press its nose, you can make a copy of yourself. It first appeared in Fujiko’s other manga “Perman”.</p>

    <!-- doremon story-->
    <p>It all starts on a New Year’s Day, when Doraemon suddenly appears from the drawer of Nobita’s desk. Doraemon comes from the future, and is with Nobita’s great-great-grandson, Sewashi.
